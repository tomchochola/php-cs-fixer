- Strict and Essential rule sets included.
- Finder configuration included for customizable file search.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Composer 2.5+

## Installation

1. Create a directory `tools/php-cs-fixer` in your project.
2. Inside `tools/php-cs-fixer`, create a `composer.json` file with the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "require": {
       "php": "^8.2"
     },
     "require-dev": {
       "composer/composer": "^2.5",
       "tomchochola/php-cs-fixer": "dev-main"
     },
     "repositories": [
       {
         "type": "git",
         "url": "git@github.com:tomchochola/php-cs-fixer.git"
       }
     ],
     "minimum-stability": "stable",
     "prefer-stable": true,
     "config": {
       "optimize-autoloader": true,
       "preferred-install": "dist",
       "sort-packages": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. Create a `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` file in your project root with the following content:

   ```php
   <?php

   declare(strict_types=1);

   return Tomchochola\PhpCsFixer\Fixer::strict(__DIR__);
   ```

### Git Configuration

Add the following lines to your `.gitignore` to prevent these files from being versioned:

```
# tools
/tools/*/vendor
/tools/*/composer.lock
```

## Usage

### Makefile for Code Quality Management

Place the following Makefile in your project root:

```makefile
# Default shell
SHELL := /bin/bash

# Variables
MAKE_PHP_8_2_BIN ?= php8.2
MAKE_COMPOSER_2_BIN ?= /usr/local/bin/composer2

MAKE_PHP ?= ${MAKE_PHP_8_2_BIN}
MAKE_COMPOSER ?= ${MAKE_PHP} ${MAKE_COMPOSER_2_BIN}

# Default goal
.DEFAULT_GOAL := assert-never

# Goals
.PHONY: check
check: lint audit

.PHONY: audit
audit: vendor
	${MAKE_COMPOSER} audit

.PHONY: lint
lint: vendor tools
	${MAKE_COMPOSER} validate --strict
	${MAKE_PHP} tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff

.PHONY: fix
fix: vendor tools
	${MAKE_PHP} tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix

.PHONY: composer
composer:
	${MAKE_COMPOSER} install

.PHONY: composer-no-dev
composer-no-dev:
	${MAKE_COMPOSER} install --no-dev -a

.PHONY: clean-composer
clean-composer:
	git clean -xfd vendor composer.lock

.PHONY: update-composer
update-composer: clean-composer
	${MAKE_COMPOSER} update

.PHONY: clean-tools
clean-tools:
	git clean -xfd tools

.PHONY: update-tools
update-tools: clean-tools tools

.PHONY: update
update: update-tools update-composer

.PHONY: clean
clean: clean-tools clean-composer

# Dependencies
tools: tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer

vendor:
	${MAKE_COMPOSER} install

tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer:
	${MAKE_COMPOSER} --working-dir=tools/php-cs-fixer update
```

Run the following to check code quality:

```bash
make check
```

To auto-fix code issues:

```bash
make fix
```
